# background-substraction
Background Subtraction using the Gaussian Mixture-based Background/Foreground Segmentation Algorithm (MOG2). This technique is fundamental in Computer Vision for detecting moving objects (foreground) in a static scene (background)

Unlike simple frame differencing (subtracting the current frame from the previous one), MOG2 builds a statistical model of the background. This allows it to adapt to lighting changes and repetitive motions (like swaying trees) over time
